description: Analyze code quality, modularity, and identify refactoring opportunities
---
Read through $ARGUMENTS and analyze the code quality. If no file is specified, analyze the current file.

Evaluate:

1. **Modularity** - Is the code well-organized into logical units? Are responsibilities clearly separated?
2. **Readability** - Is the code self-documenting? Are names descriptive and conventions consistent?
3. **Maintainability** - How easy would it be to modify or extend this code?
4. **Dead/Legacy Code** - Identify any unused imports, unreachable code paths, deprecated patterns, or logic that should be cleaned up.
5. **Error Handling** - Are edge cases and errors handled appropriately?

Summarize the impact of potential refactor options, prioritized by effort vs. benefit.
